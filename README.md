# BackFusion

BackFusion is the REST-API of [FitFubile](https://github.com/FitFusion/FitFubile) but as it is with most REST-APIs: It's
fully self-contained and not dependent on its client...

Spring Boot app with Spring Security implemented here, hell yeah.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/FitFusion/BackFusion.git
    ```
2. Open project in IDE and select `BackFusionApplication` run config
3. Hit run/debug button

## Testing

TBD
